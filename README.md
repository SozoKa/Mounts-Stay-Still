# Horse stay still!
Stop the horse from moving away from where you left him. Because it's too likely they'll be thousands of blocks away after 5 minutes.

## üìñ Instructions:
Works with **any entity\*** that can be ridden with a saddle! Because only they are good boys :)
- If you remove the saddle while you're on the horse, it will no longer work.
- But if you remove the saddle **after** leaving the horse, it will stay still!

_**\* limited to horse-like entities only in versions below 25w03a (1.21.5 snapshot)! (horse, zombie/skeleton horse, camel, donkey, mule... so **not** pigs, striders, ...)**_
